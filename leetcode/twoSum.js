// Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

// You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

// You can return the answer in any order.


//  * @param {number[]} nums
//  * @param {number} target
//  * @return {number[]}

 var twoSum = function(nums, target) {

 };
 //1. create result variable to return at end
 //2. loop through array first time
 //3. set a variable to hold current space
 //4. loop through array second time
 //5. set condition that both numbers must equal the target, not be the same index & not have a result already
 //6. add numbers that successfully meet condition to result
 //7. outside of nested loop, return result variable
