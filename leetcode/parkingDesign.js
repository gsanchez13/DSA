// Design a parking system for a parking lot. The parking lot has three kinds of parking spaces: big, medium, and small, with a fixed number of slots for each size.

// Implement the ParkingSystem class:

// ParkingSystem(int big, int medium, int small) Initializes object of the ParkingSystem class. The number of slots for each parking space are given as part of the constructor.
// bool addCar(int carType) Checks whether there is a parking space of carType for the car that wants to get into the parking lot. carType can be of three kinds: big, medium, or small, which are represented by 1, 2, and 3 respectively. A car can only park in a parking space of its carType. If there is no space available, return false, else park the car in that size space and return true.
 

// Example 1:

// Input
// ["ParkingSystem", "addCar", "addCar", "addCar", "addCar"]
// [[1, 1, 0], [1], [2], [3], [1]]
// Output
// [null, true, true, false, false]

// Explanation
// ParkingSystem parkingSystem = new ParkingSystem(1, 1, 0);
// parkingSystem.addCar(1); // return true because there is 1 available slot for a big car
// parkingSystem.addCar(2); // return true because there is 1 available slot for a medium car
// parkingSystem.addCar(3); // return false because there is no available slot for a small car
// parkingSystem.addCar(1); // return false because there is no available slot for a big car. It is already occupied.
