// Given an array of distinctive integers, determine the minimum aboslute difference between any two elements. Print all element pairs with that minimal absolute difference in ascending order.
//Ex: numbers = [6,2,4,10]
//The minimal absolute difference is 2 and the pairs with that difference are (2,4) and (4,6). When printing element pairs (i,j) they should be ordered acsending first by i and then j.
// 2 4
// 4 6
//Function Description 
//Complete the function closestNumers in the editor below. closestNumbers has the following parameter(s): int numbers[n]: an array of integers
//Returns: NONE
//Prints: distinct element pairs that share the minimal absolute difference, displayed in ascending order with each pair separated by one space on a single line.

//1. Create variable to hold key value pairs and the minimum difference that each pair will have to comply with
//2. Loop through array to find the minimum difference and build object with the minimum difference as key and the pair of integers that comply with that as the value
//3. print the values that comply with the condition of having the key as the minimum difference
