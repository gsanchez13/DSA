// Given an array of distinctive integers, determine the minimum aboslute difference between any two elements. Print all element pairs with that minimal absolute difference in ascending order.
//Ex: numbers = [6,2,4,10]
//The minimal absolute difference is 2 and the pairs with that difference are (2,4) and (4,6). When printing element pairs (i,j) they should be ordered acsending first by i and then j.
