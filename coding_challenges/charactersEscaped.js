//Given a string that consists of lowercase English letters and the characters '#' (ASCII value 35) and '!' (ASCII value 33), determine the number of times a character will be escaped. A character will be escaped if:
// it is a lowercase english letter
//there is a '!' character immediately before it and
// both the lowercase english letter and the '!' character are between a starting and an ending '#' character
//ex: '#ab!c#de!f'
//The string isescaped once at '!c'. The substring '!f' is not between '#' characters so it is not escaped. Return 1.
