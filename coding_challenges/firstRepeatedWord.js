//A sentence is minimally defined as a word or a group of words that end with a period. A word is considered to be a sequence of letters delimited by a non-letter character. A repreated word is a case-sensitive word that appears more than once in a sentence (e.g. 'had' = 'had' but 'had' != 'Had'). Because substrings of a word are not delimited, they are not considered to be words, (e.g. 'hard' is not repeared in 'hardly'). Determine the first repeated word in a sentece.
//ex: "We work hard because hard work pays."

const firstRepeatedWord = (str) => {

};
